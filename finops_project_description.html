                                The problem that the company was facing was that one department was taking the hit for all the costs produced from different platforms. The company uses several different cloud consumption platforms which are used to support different teams in the company.
                                <hr color="black">-
                                However, because there was no way to track how much cloud storage cost each individual team was incurring, those teams were unaware of or not taking responsibility for their specific cloud storage costs.
                                <hr color="black">
                                This is especially detremental to the platform teams because it is millions of dollars that is not being tracked and allocated back to the teams they support.
                                <hr color="black">
                                Management also does not have a clear picture of how much their team is costing. This could lead to inefficiency in the future.

                                Three fellow interns and I were assigned to this FinOps Analytics project to help automate the process of allocating those cloud storage consumption costs back to the specific teams.
                                <hr color="black">
                                We accomplished this by building a data warehouse that contained the cost information from the platform cources. This system includes Python scripts, SQL files, and Linux bash scripts that work together to Extract, Load, and Tranform the data.
                                <hr color="black">
                                We also developed dashboards at the end of our internships using Tableau to present our findings to business users and managers so they could easily comprehend which costs were associated with which teams.

                                <b>Note:</b>
                                <br>This system was already in motion before we were assigned to it so we took a couple weeks to learn where everything was and study the project's GitHub wiki page. We also used SQL to drill down in the data and see how it flowed through the different tables when the system was run.
